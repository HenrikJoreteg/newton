# What is Newton.js?

Newton is a JavaScript physics engine that pairs a simple API
with performance and flexibility.

# JS Physics needs a refresh

The best physics libraries available for JS are still Box2d and Chipmunk -
both of which are automated ports from very capable and popular C++ projects.
The JS ports combine the clarity and conciseness of C++ with the speed of JavaScript.

Other libraries like CoffeePhysics, Verlet-JS, and PhysicsJS are too limited or slow
for non-trivial games or simulations, so they see almost no production use.

If you're a JavaScript programmer searching for a real, from-the-ground-up,
feature-rich, easy-to-use physics engine - welcome to Newton.
