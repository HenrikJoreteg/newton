# What is Newton?

Newton is a JavaScript physics engine with a simple API
and game-ready performance characteristics.

## JS Physics needs a refresh

The best physics libraries available for JS are still Box2d and Chipmunk -
both of which are automated ports from very capable and popular C++ projects.
Unfortunately, the JS ports combine the clarity and conciseness of C++ with the speed of JavaScript.
Other libraries like CoffeePhysics, Verlet-JS, and PhysicsJS are too limited or slow
for non-trivial games and simulations, so they see almost no production use.

*If you're searching for an easy-to-use, feature-rich physics engine that's written in
optimized, idiomatic JavaScript - welcome to Newton.*
