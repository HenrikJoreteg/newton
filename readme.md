# What is Newton?

Newton is an easy-to-use, feature-rich physics engine that's designed from the ground up for JavaScript.

## JS Physics needs a refresh

The best physics libraries available for JavaScript are still
[Box2d](https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js/) and
[Chipmunk](https://github.com/josephg/Chipmunk-js) -
both of which are automated ports from very capable and popular C++ projects.
Unfortunately, the JS ports combine the clarity and conciseness of C++ with the speed of JavaScript.
Other libraries like
[CoffeePhysics](https://github.com/soulwire/Coffee-Physics),
[Verlet-JS](https://github.com/subprotocol/verlet-js), and
[PhysicsJS](https://github.com/wellcaffeinated/PhysicsJS)
are too limited or slow for non-trivial games and simulations, so they see almost no production use.
